## Front-end
- make sure angular cli is installed or install it with ```npm install -g @angular/cli```
- create a new project by ```ng new <frontend-name>``` in the project root folder.
- goto angular-cli.json, change outDir to our projects 'public' folder, so that compiled static files(html,css,bundle.js) are output to that folder
